## Actors Data Set
**Introduce your data using complete sentences.**  What kind of data set are you looking at? Why did you choose this data set?

#load the data set
```{r actors}
#Load the correct packages to open the data set
library(dyplr) 
library(readr)

#read the csv file (Insert your own name and location of the data set) 
Actors <- read_csv ("/Users/bridgetwojcik/Downloads/actors.csv")
```

## Research Question 1

Does who the Actor is effect what their total gross is?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Actors, aes(x = `Actor`, y = `Total Gross`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Actor by Total Gross",
       x = "Actor",
       y = "Total Gross")
```

##Research Question 2 

Is there a significant difference in actor and their total gross and their number of movies? 

```{r}

Num_Mov <- ("Number of Movies")
ggplot(Actors, aes(x = Actor, y = `Total Gross`, fill = as.factor(Num_Mov))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Actor by Total Gross and Number of Movies",
       x = "Actor",
       y = "Total Gross",
       fill = "Number of Movies") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")  

        
```
