```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Actors Data Set

```{r actors}
#Load the correct packages to open the data set
library(dyplr) 
library(readr)

#read the csv file (Insert your own name and location of the data set) 
Actors <- read_csv ("/Users/bridgetwojcik/Downloads/actors.csv")
```

## Research Question 1

What is the relationship between Actor and Total Gross?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Actors, aes(x = `Actor`, y = `Total Gross`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Actor by Total Gross",
       x = "Actor",
       y = "Total Gross")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
